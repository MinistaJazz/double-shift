      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
      <div class="subtitle">DOUBLE SHIFT / JOANNA DD · Effective Date: January 1, 2026</div>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>1. OUR POSITION ON PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>Double Shift is built by Black women inside the Digital Kitchen. Privacy is not a checkbox or a commodity here; it is a relationship and a responsibility.</p>
      <p>When this policy says “we,” “us,” or “our,” it means the company that operates Joanna DD. This policy describes how we handle information for people who use Joanna DD in the United States, including over the phone.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>
      <p>When you interact with Joanna DD (including by phone), we may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone number</strong> (to connect the call, manage access, and prevent abuse)</li>
        <li><strong>Text transcripts</strong> of your conversations (created from call audio so the service can understand and respond)</li>
        <li><strong>Basic interaction metadata</strong> (such as call duration, timestamps, call status, and technical logs)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We primarily retain text transcripts and related metadata, not raw call audio. Raw call audio, if processed at all, is handled temporarily by our service providers solely to create transcripts and is not intentionally retained by us beyond what is necessary to operate the service.</p>

      <p>We do not intentionally collect precise GPS-level location, contact lists, or social media account data. Network information such as general region or IP address may be processed by us or our providers as part of delivering the service.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. CONSENT TO TRANSCRIPTION AND AI PROCESSING</h2>
      <p>When you call Joanna DD, your conversation may be transcribed and processed by AI systems so the service can respond to you. At the beginning of the call, you will hear a brief notice that the conversation may be transcribed and processed using AI.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Consent by continued use:</strong> By staying on the line and continuing the call after that notice, you consent to (1) transcription of the call and (2) processing of that transcript and related metadata by our systems and our service providers.</p>
      </div>

      <p>This applies even if you live in a state that requires all-party consent for recording or transcription. If you do not agree, you should end the call.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. WHY WE COLLECT IT</h2>
      <p>We collect and use this data primarily to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate and maintain the Joanna DD experience</li>
        <li>Improve timing, responsiveness, safety, and system quality</li>
        <li>Prevent misuse, abuse, fraud, or system manipulation</li>
        <li>Support billing, access controls, and other legitimate business and legal needs where applicable</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not use your conversations to build advertising profiles or run targeted advertising. We may use de-identified and aggregated data to improve our systems and models, but we do not use your identifiable conversations to train unrelated third-party AI models outside of the Joanna DD experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. WHAT WE DO NOT DO</h2>
      <p>We do not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sell, rent, or trade your personal data with data brokers</li>
        <li>Run targeted advertising based on your conversations</li>
        <li>Allow partners to use your identifiable conversations to train their own general-purpose AI models for advertising or unrelated products</li>
        <li>Train unrelated third-party AI models using your conversations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your data is not a product here. The experience is the product.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. DATA RETENTION</h2>
      <p>Audio for calls may be briefly processed by our providers to create transcripts, but we primarily retain text transcripts and related metadata, not raw audio.</p>

      <p>Data may be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Retained for a limited period necessary to operate, secure, and improve the service (generally measured in weeks or months, not years, unless we must keep it longer for legal, security, or fraud-prevention reasons)</li>
        <li>Anonymized or aggregated so it no longer reasonably identifies you</li>
        <li>Deleted as part of internal review and safety cycles</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Retention timelines may change as the system evolves and as laws change. When we make meaningful changes, we will update this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. DATA DELETION & USER RIGHTS</h2>
      <p>You may request deletion of your call data or transcripts by contacting us through the methods listed on our website. We may need to verify that you are the owner of the phone number or interaction before acting on a request.</p>

      <p>We will make reasonable efforts to honor deletion requests, subject to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical feasibility (for example, data stored in limited-access backups)</li>
        <li>Legal obligations (such as records we must retain for tax, fraud-prevention, or safety reasons)</li>
        <li>System integrity requirements (such as logs needed to secure the service or investigate misuse)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We do not require you to create an account to make a deletion request.</p>
      <p>Depending on where you live, you may have additional rights (such as access or portability) under local law. If those laws apply to you and to this service, we will respect those rights consistent with our technical and legal obligations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. THIRD-PARTY INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>
      <p>Joanna DD operates using third-party telecommunications and AI infrastructure providers. These partners help us connect calls, create transcripts, and deliver the experience.</p>

      <p>These partners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Process data as needed to deliver, maintain, and secure the service, and as otherwise permitted under their contracts with us</li>
        <li>Are contractually restricted from selling your personal data or using your identifiable conversations for their own independent advertising or general-purpose model training</li>
        <li>Do not gain independent ownership rights over your personal data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We may work with AI infrastructure providers to test and improve Joanna DD, including through de-identified or aggregated data, under contracts that limit how they can use that data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. SECURITY PRACTICES</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect data from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure. These measures include limiting who can access transcripts, using secure transmission methods, and conducting periodic internal reviews of our privacy and security practices.</p>
      <p>No system is perfectly secure. By using the service, you acknowledge that risk while we commit to responsible stewardship of the information we hold.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>This service is intended for adults 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.</p>
      <p>If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take reasonable steps to delete that data as soon as practical, except where law requires a different approach.</p>
      <p>If you are under 18, you should only use the service with the consent of a parent or guardian, where permitted by law. (And respectfully: this experience is designed for adults.)</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. LEGAL REQUESTS & SAFETY</h2>
      <p>We may preserve and disclose information when we reasonably believe it is necessary to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal requests</li>
        <li>Protect the rights, safety, or property of users, the public, or the service</li>
        <li>Detect, investigate, or address fraud, security, or technical issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When we respond to legal requests, we try to limit what we share to what is legally required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated as the project grows, technology evolves, or legal requirements change. The effective date will always be posted at the top of this page.</p>
      <p>If we make material changes, we will provide additional notice, such as updating this page and, where appropriate, showing an in-product or in-call notice. Continued use of the service after changes become effective indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>13. CONTACT</h2>
      <p>Questions or concerns about privacy can be directed through the contact methods listed on our official website. If you have specific questions about your data, please include the phone number you used with Joanna DD so we can locate relevant records.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>14. FINAL NOTE (INTENTIONAL)</h2>
      <p>This project exists to demonstrate what ethical, consent-driven AI can look like when culture, care, and ownership come first. Privacy is not an afterthought here; it is part of the design.</p>
